# Ghetto-People-s-Respository

Welcome to Ghetto People's Respository.
This website is made to store downloadable files onto the school computer.
Specific details for each app/ file are included in the .zip file.

But please, note this only rule.....

 # *INSTALL THE FILES ONTO YOUR ONEDRIVE! PLEASE!*
  *It's not hard. Wherever it says "Destination Folder" CHANGE THAT TO ONEDRIVE: HCPS. The files will go wherever you go , so if you log in and get that lovely
  message that reads "You are now syncing Onedrive: HCPS" just head onto file explorer, click Onedrive and your files will be right there. You have to let them 
  upload to your onedrive after your done tho. If it's a zip file, just extract it to your onedirve. please. its not rocket science. please.*

# APPS
I recomend you get Tor Browser first.
Then QEMU or Sun Virtualbox, for a virtual machine (a computer inside of a computer)
Try to use psiphon to bypass the proxy settings...

  That's all for now. If you have a request for a specific app, email me at alphafanumtax@gmail.com. Have fun!
